    <h2>Nothing else matters</h2>
    <h4>by Metallica <i class="fas fa-guitar"></i></h4>
    <p>So close no matter how far
        Couldn't be much more from the heart
        Forever trusting who we are
        And nothing else matters</p>
    <p>Never opened myself this way
        Life is ours, we live it our way
        All these words I don't just say
        And nothing else matters</p>
    <p>Trust I seek and I find in you
        Every day for us something new
        Open mind for a different view
        And nothing else matters</p>
    <p>Never cared for what they do
        Never cared for what they know
        But I know</p>
    <p>So close no matter how far
        It couldn't be much more from the heart
        Forever trusting who we are
        And nothing else matters</p>
    <p>Never cared for what they do
        Never cared for what they know
        But I know</p>
    <p>I never opened myself this way

        Open mind for a different view
        And nothing else matters</p>
    <p>Never cared for what they say
        Never cared for games they play
        Never cared for what they do
        Never cared for what they know
        And I know, yeah</p>
    <p>So close no matter how far
        Couldn't be much more from the heart
        Forever trusting who we are
        No, nothing else matters</p>
